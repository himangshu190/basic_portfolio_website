basic portfolio website using html and css
Creating a portfolio website involves several steps, including designing the user interface, coding the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then hosting it on a web server. Here, I'll provide you with a simple example of a portfolio website's frontend code to get you started. Please note that this is a basic template, and you can customize it further according to your needs and preferences.
JavaScript (script.js):
This file is empty for now but can be used to add interactivity to your website using JavaScript.

Add your portfolio projects:
Inside the "Portfolio" section of your HTML (index.html), you can add your portfolio projects using HTML and CSS. For each project, you can create a card with a title, description, and an image.

Customization:
Feel free to customize the styles, content, and structure of the website to make it unique and tailored to your needs.

Once you have created these files, you can host your website on a web server or use a platform like GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting.
